# Intro-To-Python-Challenges üêç

As a Careerist graduate, I had the opportunity to enroll in a coding challenge-based course designed to emulate platforms like HackerRank. Each module featured a variety of coding challenges and assignments that tested my problem-solving abilities and technical knowledge. The course utilized PyCharm as the primary IDE, and I successfully met all the instructor's requirements for the code submissions.

This program was tailored for individuals aiming to advance their careers, demanding a high level of dedication, technical skill, and the ability to work independently and with diligence. It provided an excellent platform to strengthen my coding expertise and further develop my professional competencies.
